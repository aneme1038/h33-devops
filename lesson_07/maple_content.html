<h3>Maple</h3>

<p>Maple (Acer) is a genus of about 132 species of trees and shrubs in the family Sapindaceae, native to Asia, Europe, North Africa, and North America. They are known for their distinctive palmate leaves and winged fruits called samaras.</p>

<p>Maples are mostly deciduous, though a few species are evergreen. Many species are valued for their timber, ornamental beauty, and sap, which is used to produce maple syrup. North America and Asia are the main centers of maple diversity, with species such as the sugar maple (Acer saccharum) and the Japanese maple (Acer palmatum) being especially well-known.</p>
